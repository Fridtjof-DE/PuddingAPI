A collection of my shared libraries that I use for various projects, such as my (upcoming) Bukkit plugins. Intended use for myself only.

## How to Build

If you are looking to make changes, then you'll need to get both a JDK 17 and Maven installed on your computer. I recommend just using an IDE like Intellij IDEA or Eclipse.

Once you have them set up you'll need to run Maven:

```
mvn package
```

Results will be in the `builds` folder, with base name
`PuddingAPI`. The version number is made up of the current date.
(see timestamp format in pom.xml), you'll have a file in this format:

  - `PuddingAPI-yyMMddHHmm.jar`

Copy this file over to the plugins folder of your Minecraft server or use it as a dependency when working on other plugins.
